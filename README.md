# What we want you to take after this workshop

This is a piece of advice that quite resonates with me. It is by [Cory House.](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1019199012908552192)

We want you to:

- explore with an open mind what React Native can offer to you,
- and hopefully after the end of the workshop you will consider it worth investing your own time to learn more of React Native.
