# Chapter 1 - Introduction

1. What is React & React Native?

    > **React Native** is a framework that allows you to build **native** mobile apps using **JavaScript**.  
      
      ------
    
    > **React Native** is not about avoiding any native development, itâ€™s more about boosting productivity and sharing business logic and practices among very different platforms. [[1]](https://github.com/Michael-Antczak/ScotlandJS-React-Native-Workshop/blob/master/chapters/1-Introduction.md#resources) . 
      

2. Why need for React Native?

    - Learn Once, Write Anywhere - reuse ideas and skills across platforms
    - make mobile dev experience as quick as that of a web developer
    - maintain one codebase instead of two
    - cost of hiring a native developer
    - increase the pool of mobile developers

Also, have a look at the follow up by Charlie Cheever from Expo team [[3]](https://github.com/Michael-Antczak/ScotlandJS-React-Native-Workshop/blob/master/chapters/1-Introduction.md#resources).

    YES and NO.
