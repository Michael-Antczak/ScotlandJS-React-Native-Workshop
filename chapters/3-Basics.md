Those are the components that we will use:

1.  [View](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view)
2.  [Text](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/text)
3.  [Image](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/image)
4.  [Button](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/button)
5.  [Alert](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/alert)

Components in React Native - custom components - wrapper around Text.


> **RN Wisdom**: Just wrap components straight away when you start a project. Don't use `<Text>` directly, have your own `<AppText>` or similar. You will come to need it.

> **RN Wisdom**: Use a `scale` function to have relative widths and heights. It will save you a lot of headache with layout issues (especially on android)
