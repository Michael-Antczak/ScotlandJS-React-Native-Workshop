# Chapter 7 - Navigation

Here are

1.  What are the navigation options available in React Native?
    - [React Native Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - a JavaScript solution that is a good starting point with Stack and Tab Navigator.
    - [React Native Navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) - currently working on v2.
    - [Native Navigation](http://airbnb.io/native-navigation/) - native solution, but not production ready yet.
    - [NavigatorIOS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation#navigatorios) - for iOS only.
